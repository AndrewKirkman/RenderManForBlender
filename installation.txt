BlenderMan Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------

Frist, get and install the Non-Commercial Version of RenderMan from Pixar.  Package and 
installation instructions at: http://rendermansite.pixar.com/view/get-renderman 
You need to install at a minimum RenderMan Pro Server 19.0

Unpack and move the blenderman folder into your blender addons folder. You can then enable the addon in the Addons tab of blender user preferences

RenderMan normally bases everything off a variable RMANTREE which is set to your installation
folder, eg /Applications/Pixar/RenderManProServer-19.0 on OSX.  

BlenderMan will try and guess the appropriate RenderMan version to use and the location of
the folder.  However, if you installed in a non-standard location, set the RMANTREE 
environment variable when starting blender.
